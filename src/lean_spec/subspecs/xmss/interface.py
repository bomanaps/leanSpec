def verify(pk: PublicKey, epoch: int, message: bytes, sig: Signature) -> bool:
    r"""
    Verifies a digital signature against a public key, message, and epoch. This
    is a **deterministic** algorithm.

    This function is a placeholder. The complete verification logic is detailed
    below and will be implemented in a future update.

    ### Verification Algorithm

    1.  **Re-encode Message**: The verifier uses the randomness `rho` from the
        signature to re-compute the codeword $x = (x_1, \dots, x_v)$ from the
        message `m`.
        This includes calculating the checksum or checking the target sum.

    2.  **Reconstruct One-Time Public Key**: For each intermediate hash $y_i$
        in the signature, the verifier completes the corresponding hash chain.
        Since $y_i$ was computed with $x_i$ steps, the verifier applies the
        hash function an additional $w - 1 - x_i$ times to arrive at the
        one-time public key component $pk_{ep,i}$.

    3.  **Compute Merkle Leaf**: The verifier hashes the reconstructed one-time
        public key components to compute the expected Merkle leaf for `epoch`.

    4.  **Verify Merkle Path**: The verifier uses the `path` from the signature
        to compute a candidate Merkle root starting from the computed leaf.
        Verification succeeds if and only if this candidate root matches the
        `root` in the `PublicKey`.

    Args:
        pk: The public key to verify against.
        epoch: The epoch the signature corresponds to.
        message: The message that was supposedly signed.
        sig: The signature object to be verified.

    Returns:
        `True` if the signature is valid, `False` otherwise.
